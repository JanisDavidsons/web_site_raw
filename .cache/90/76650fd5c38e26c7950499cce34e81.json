Thanks to my brother, I came across amazing school called <a id=\"external_link\" href=\"https://www.codelex.io/\">Codelex</a>. They were about to launch three days programming course in the end of january, so I applied for it. I was amazed about exercises they offered. In fact - three of those were actualy games. Those games were prepared only as sceleton that we had to build upon. Basicly we had to implement game logic. Now that was extremely engaging! I would like to share those with you. Please remember, I`m actualy learning on the fly, which means - you might find bugs on this website and also in those games. I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by by A LOT of work.</p> </article> <article> <h2>Web site develop by Janis Davidsons</h2> <p> I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and progress. <br> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
