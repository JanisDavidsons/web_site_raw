        <h2>Web site develop by Janis Davidsons</h2>
        <p>
          <br />
          I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and
          progress. <br />
          In the beginning it might look weird or unfinished, but as my
          knowledge grows - webpage will develop.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <h2>P5.js library</h2>
        <p>
          
          &nbsp Below is small experiment,
          <br /> which I made while learned javaScript
          objects. I made a circle class, from which circle objects are made.
          Press left mouse button to create more circle instaces from circle
          function constructor. Random size and color circle will apear on
          screen where mouse is ponted. Refresh page to clear circles.
        </p>

          <div 
             id = "p5sketch"> <!--circle project goes here. -->
          </div>

        <p>
          Code snipet of circle project<br />
          I used P5.js library to make this. Make sure to check
          this out --><a id="external_link" href="https://p5js.org/"
            >p5.js javaScript library</a
          ><br />
          Here is code for this program. Click on image to enlarge it.
          CSS and Javascript magic will apear.. :)<br />

        <h2>About Codelex!</h2>
        <p>
          17th of february 2020 <br />
          
        &nbsp Two months ago I decided to change my career to Information technology as a programmer.
        Thanks to my brother, I came across amazing school called 
        <a id="external_link" href="https://www.codelex.io/">Codelex</a>. 
        They were about to launch three days programming course at the end of January, so I 
        applied for it. This gave me insight into what it means to be a programmer.
        After this, I decided to carry on and applied for three months' courses to become a professional programmer.
        Please remember, I`m learning on the fly, which means - you might find bugs on this website and also in those games.
        I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by A LOT of work.</p><br/><br/>

        <p>
          This website is static. <br/>
          &nbsp All text you see here is written manually inside HTML document.
          As my knowledge grows and I`m getting more comfortable with 
          PHP and databases, its time to move all text content to the MariaDB server and render content dynamically using PHP. I hope not to destroy this web site by
           doing this. Also, I changed the editor in which I'm writing code - I moved from Visual Studio Code to PHP storm. 
          I'm not sure what to do with games written in Javascript, because after I wrote code Parcel is used to build it. Right now I have no idea how to do this
           in PHP storm. <br />

        <h2>Update 16`th of march, 2020</h2>
        <p>
          I have learned a lot about Git.<br />
          Version control of this website has already saved me from a disastrous situation a couple of times.
          There were situations, where I screwed up code so badly, that  I would have to start everything from scratch!
          I`m the person who tries to realize idea as it comes into my mind. 
          Sometimes that brings very very cool stuff into reality, sometimes it destroys everything...
          Luckily I always have backups available from git! This is where git version control shines.
          As long as you commit your changes to git, you are safe to experiment and try your craziest ideas. 
          Not worrying about breaking things. You can always recover if things go bad, git remote I'm using is GitHub.
          You are welcome to check out the history of this website's code
          if you like here ---><a href="https://github.com/JanisDavidsons" >my github</a> 
          There are two repositories available. One is called "web_site_raw",  which is easy to explore.
          Another one is called "website_built", which is compiled by parcel for deployment on the server.
          "website_built" is shared directly to webserver called <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">"Netlify".</a>
          When I commit changes to this repository, the webserver gets upgraded automatically. Nice! 
          There are more repositories, which I will talk about another time. They have nothing to do with this page.
          Those are different projects.
