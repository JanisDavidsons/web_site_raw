          I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and
          progress. <br />
          In the beginning it might look weird or unfinished, but as my

          &nbsp Below is small experiment, which I made while learned javaScript
          objects. I made a circle class, from which circle objects are made.
          Press left mouse button to create more circle instaces from circle
          function constructor. Random size and color circle will apear on
          screen where mouse is ponted. Refresh page to clear circles.

          17th of february 2020 <br />
          
        &nbsp Two month ago I made decition to change my career to Information technology as programmer. Thanks to my brother, I came across
        amazing school called <a id="external_link" href="https://www.codelex.io/">Codelex</a>. They were about to launch three days programming course in the end of january, so I 
        applied for it. I was amazed about exercises they offered. In fact - three of those were actually games. Those games 
        were prepared only as sceleton that we had to build upon. Basicly we had to implement game logic. Now that was extremely engaging! 
        I would like to share those with you. Please remember, I`m actualy learning on the fly, which means - you 
        might find bugs on this website and also in those games. I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by
        by A LOT of work.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>
