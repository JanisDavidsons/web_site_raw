          I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and

          In the beginning it might look weird or unfinished, but as my

          &nbsp Below is small experiment, which I made while learned javaScript
          objects. I made a circle class, from which circle objects are made.
          Press left mouse button to create more circle instaces from circle
          function constructor. Random size and color circle will apear on
          screen where mouse is ponted. Refresh page to clear circles.

        <p>
          Code snipet of circle project<br>
          I used P5.js library to make this. Make sure to check
          this out --><a id="external_link" href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js javaScript library</a><br>
          Here is code for this program.<br>

        <h2>About Codelex!</h2>
        <p>
          17th of february 2020 <br>
          
        &nbsp Two month ago I made decition to change my career to Information technology as programmer. Thanks to my brother, I came across
        amazing school called <a id="external_link" href="https://www.codelex.io/">Codelex</a>. They were about to launch three days programming course in the end of january, so I 
        applied for it. I was amazed about exercises they offered. In fact - three of those were actually games. Those games 
        were prepared only as sceleton that we had to build upon. Basicly we had to implement game logic. Now that was extremely engaging! 
        I would like to share those with you. Please remember, I`m actualy learning on the fly, which means - you 
        might find bugs on this website and also in those games. I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by
        by A LOT of work.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Update 14`th of march, 2020</h2>
        <p>
          This website is static, all text you see here is written manually inside HTML document. <br>

          &nbsp As my knowledge grows and I`m getting more comfortable with 
          PHP and databases, its time to move all text content to the MariaDB server and render content dynamically using PHP. I hope not to destroy this web site by
           doing this. Also, I changed the editor in which I'm writing code - I moved from Visual Studio Code to PHP storm. 
          I'm not sure what to do with games written in Javascript, because after I wrote code Parcel is used to build it. Right now I have no idea how to do this
           in PHP storm. <br>
