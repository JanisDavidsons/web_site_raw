This gave me insight into what it means to be a programmer.\n        After this, I decided to carry on and applied for three months' courses to become a professional programmer.\n        Please remember, I`m learning on the fly, which means - you might find bugs on this website and also in those games.\n        I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by A LOT of work.</p><br><br>\n      </article>\n      <article>\n        <h2>Update 14`th of march, 2020</h2>\n        <p>\n          This website is static. <br>\n          &nbsp All text you see here is written manually inside HTML document.\n          As my knowledge grows and I`m getting more comfortable with \n          PHP and databases, its time to move all text content to the MariaDB server and render content dynamically using PHP. I hope not to destroy this web site by\n           doing this. Also, I changed the editor in which I'm writing code - I moved from Visual Studio Code to PHP storm. \n          I'm not sure what to do with games written in Javascript, because after I wrote code Parcel is used to build it. Right now I have no idea how to do this\n           in PHP storm. <br>\n          \n        </p>\n      </article>\n      <article>\n        <br><br>\n        <h2>Update 16`th of march, 2020</h2>\n        <p>\n          I have learned a lot about Git.<br>\n          Version control of this website has already saved me from a disastrous situation a couple of times.\n          There were situations, where I screwed up code so badly, that  I would have to start everything from scratch!\n          I`m the person who tries to realize idea as it comes into my mind. \n          Sometimes that brings very very cool stuff into reality, sometimes it destroys everything...\n          Luckily I always have backups available from git! This is where git version control shines.\n          As long as you commit your changes to git, you are safe to experiment and try your craziest ideas. \n          Not worrying about breaking things. You can always recover if things go bad, git remote I'm using is GitHub.\n          You are welcome to check out the history of this website's code\n          if you like here ---><a href=\"https://github.com/JanisDavidsons\">my github</a> \n          There are two repositories available. One is called \"web_site_raw\",  which is easy to explore.\n          Another one is called \"website_built\", which is compiled by parcel for deployment on the server.\n          \"website_built\" is shared directly to webserver called <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">\"Netlify\".</a>\n          When I commit changes to this repository, the webserver gets upgraded automatically. Nice! \n          There are more repositories, which I will talk about another time. They have nothing to do with this page.\n          Those are different projects.\n          <br><br>\n        </p>\n      </article>\n      <br><br>\n      <article>\n        <h2>Web site develop by Janis Davidsons</h2>\n        <p>\n          I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and\n          progress. <br>\n          In the beginning it might look weird or unfinished, but as my\n          knowledge grows - webpage will develop.<br><br>\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
