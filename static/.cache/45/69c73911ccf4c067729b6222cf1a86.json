Thanks to my brother, I came across amazing school called <a id=\"external_link\" href=\"https://www.codelex.io/\">Codelex</a>. They were about to launch three days programming course in the end of january, so I applied for it. I was amazed about exercises they offered. In fact - three of those were actually games. Those games were prepared only as sceleton that we had to build upon. Basicly we had to implement game logic. Now that was extremely engaging! I would like to share those with you. Please remember, I`m actualy learning on the fly, which means - you might find bugs on this website and also in those games. I have very poor programming experience, all of this is achieved by by A LOT of work.</p><br><br> </article> <article> <h2>Update 14`th of march, 2020</h2> <p> This website is static, all text you see here is written manually inside HTML document. <br> &nbsp As my knowledge grows and I`m getting more comfortable with PHP and databases, its time to move all text content to the MariaDB server and render content dynamically using PHP. I hope not to destroy this web site by doing this. Also, I changed the editor in which I'm writing code - I moved from Visual Studio Code to PHP storm. I'm not sure what to do with games written in Javascript, because after I wrote code Parcel is used to build it. Right now I have no idea how to do this in PHP storm. <br> </p> </article> <article> <br><br> <h2>Web site develop by Janis Davidsons</h2> <p> I created this webpage to store and reviev my programming studies and progress.<br> In the beginning it might look weird or unfinished, but as my knowledge grows - webpage will develop.<br><br>\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
